# Requirements:
# Build a program where a user can input a number.
# The user will see two words, either "even" or "odd".
# "even" means that the number ends in either "0", "2", "4", "6", or "8"
# "odd" means that the number ends in either "1", "3", "5", "7", or "9"

# Implementation plans:
# Create a variable that askes the user to enter a number.
# Convert the variable to a number by using an integer
# Check if the variable is even or odd
# Reply by saying "even" or "odd" using the "print" command inside the if.

word = "dinosaur"
print(word[3])
print(len(word))
print(word[len(word)-1]) # this means the last letter of the word
